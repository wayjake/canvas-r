# introduction
this was a 45 minute product development design sprint meant to model how Remix can be used to flesh out functional prototypes quickly while creating an application architecture that can really scale.

**to run this:**
```
git clone https://github.com/wayjake/canvas-r.git
cd ./canvas-r
npm install
echo "CUR_ACCESS_CODE=111" > .env
npm run dev
```
